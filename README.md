# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in a POST request.  The `createUser` function lacks input validation and robust error management.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows a `POST /users` route that attempts to create a user. However, it fails to handle cases where:

* The request body is missing or malformed.
* The database operation fails.

This can lead to unexpected crashes or silent failures, making it difficult to debug and maintain the application.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation that includes:

* Input validation to ensure the request body contains the necessary data.
* Comprehensive error handling to catch database errors and send appropriate responses.

This improved error handling enhances the robustness and reliability of the application.
